```ts
interface User {
    name: string
    surname?: string
    age: number
}

const users: User[] = [{
    name: "alice",
    surname: "zuberg",
    age: 19
}, {
    name: "asuna",
    surname: "yuuki",
    age: 19
}, {
    name: "kazuto",
    surname: "Kirigaya",
    age: 17
}]
```

```ts
import { ProjectError, wrap } from '@sirutils/core'

const getUser = wrap((name: User["name"]) => {
    const found = users.find(user => user.name === name)

    if(!found) {
        return ProjectError.create("?not-found", "user not found").throw()
    }

    return found
}, "?get-user")

const addUser = wrap((user: User) => {
    const exists = getUser(user.name)

        return ProjectError.create("exists", `user: ${user.name} already exists`).throw()
    }

    users.push(user)

const result = addUser({
    name: "yui",
    age: 2

    console.log(result.error)
    process.exit()
}

console.log(result.value)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the use of error handling in JavaScript, utilizing a utility function `wrap` from the `@sirutils/core` library, and a custom `ProjectError` class for managing errors. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

#### 1. Import Statements:
```ts
import { ProjectError, wrap } from '@sirutils/core'
```
- `ProjectError`: A custom error class that likely has methods for creating and throwing errors.

- `wrap`: A utility function that wraps other functions, enabling additional functionality such as automatic error handling or logging.

#### 2. The getUser Function:

```ts
const getUser = wrap((name: User["name"]) => {
    const found = users.find(user => user.name === name)

    if(!found) {
        return ProjectError.create("?not-found", "user not found").throw()
    }

    return found
}, "?get-user")
```

- **Purpose**: This function searches for a user by their `name` in the `users` array.
- **Logic**:
    -It attempts to find the user by their name.
    - If the user is not found, it creates and throws a `ProjectError` with the message `"user not found"` and an error code `"?not-found"`.
    - If the user is found, it returns the user object.
- `wrap`: The function is wrapped with `wrap`, which likely enhances it by automatically managing the function’s return values, possibly converting thrown errors into structured results.

#### 3. The `addUser` Function:

```ts
const addUser = wrap((user: User) => {
    const exists = getUser(user.name) 

    if(exists.isOk()) {
        return ProjectError.create("exists", `user: ${user.name} already exists`).throw()
    }

    users.push(user)

    return true
}, "?add-user")
```

- **Purpose**: This function attempts to add a new user to the `users` array.
- **Logic**:
    - It first checks if a user with the same name already exists using the `getUser` function.
    - If the user exists (i.e., `getUser` returned a successful result), it creates and throws a `ProjectError` with the message "user already exists" and an error code `"exists"`.
    - If the user doesn’t exist, it adds the new user to the `users` array and returns `true`.
- `wrap`: Like `getUser`, `addUser` is also wrapped, which likely ensures that errors are managed and the function consistently returns a structured result.

### 4. Executing `addUser` and Handling the Result:
```ts
const result = addUser({
    name: "yui",
    age: 2
})

if(result.isErr()) {
    console.log(result.error)

    process.exit()
}

console.log(result.value)
```

- **Adding a User**: The `addUser` function is called with a user object `{ name: "yui", age: 2 }`.
- **Error Handling**:
    - If `addUser` returns an error result (`result.isErr()`), it logs the error and exits the process.
    - If no error occurs, it logs the `result.value`, which would be `true` in this case if the user was successfully added.

### Summary:
- The code is designed to safely manage adding and retrieving users from a list.
- `wrap` ensures consistent error handling and result management.
- `ProjectError` provides a structured way to create, throw, and handle errors.
- The code flow is designed to stop execution if errors occur, preventing further processing of invalid states.
